When working with multi-dimensional data, visualization can be a powerful tool for understanding and exploring complex structures. Thatâ€™s why I built a **2D Array Visualizer** using React. This project allows users to input a 2D array and view its representation as an interactive grid. Along the way, I added features like customizable colors for cells and error handling for invalid input.

In this post, I'll walk you through the journey of building this project and share some of the core features and challenges I encountered. Let's dive in!

### Project Overview

The 2D Array Visualizer is a simple yet powerful React project that takes user input in the form of a 2D array and displays it visually as a grid. The grid can be customized to give each unique value its own color, and users can modify the text and border colors of the entire grid as well.

#### Key Features:

- Users can input a 2D array to visualize it.
- The app ensures the input is a valid 2D array; otherwise, it displays an error message.
- Each unique value in the array can have a custom cell color.
- The grid's border color and text color are fully customizable.

#### Tech Stack:

- **React** for the frontend.
- **Tailwind** for the grid styling and customizations.

This project is perfect for those looking to build a dynamic and interactive UI while learning about data validation, state management, and custom styling in React.
